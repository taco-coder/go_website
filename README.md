# File Management Site
This project is intended to teach me about Go, Go-Gin, a little bit of Docker and Kubernetes, as well as working more with API Gateway. It'll also give me more experience working with various DB types (so far I'm planning on using Postgres and MongoDB; maybe ElasticSearch for searching but I'll need to look into that more). The end goal is to have a file management implementing a microservice architecture.

### Done so Far
Go the creds-service docker container on a VM and setup API gateway to be able to successfully reach it. 
### To-Do
Got the DB server setup but need to hook that up to the backend. 

#### Side Note
The front end of this site might look ugly for a while cause I'm more of a backend focused guy and don't know any cool and fancy frontend frameworks like React. Just jQuery.
