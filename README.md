# File Management Site
This project is intended to teach me about Go, Go-Gin, a little bit of Docker and Kubernetes, as well as working more with API Gateway. It'll also give me more experience working with various DB types (so far I'm planning on using Postgres and MongoDB; maybe ElasticSearch for searching but I'll need to look into that more). The end goal is to have a file management implementing a microservice architecture.

### Done so Far
Just barely got a Docker container running Apache to house the static HTML and JS files.
### To-Do
Still need to create the first full round trip which will be user authentication. Once I've implemented the first API call that makes its way across the containers, the rest will get easier cause the architecture and connections will have been figured out. 

#### Side Note
The front end of this site might look ugly for a while cause I'm more of a backend focused guy and don't know any cool and fancy frontend frameworks like React. Just jQuery.
